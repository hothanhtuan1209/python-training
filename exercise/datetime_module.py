This module contains a code for exercises 16-2 related to:
Think Python, 2nd Edition
Chapter 16: Classes and Functions

- Write a program that gets the current date and prints the day of the week.
- Write a program that takes a birthday as input and prints the userâ€™s age and the
number of days, hours, minutes and seconds until their next birthday.
- Takes two birthdays and computes their Double Day.
- Write the more general version that computes the day when one person is n times older than the other.
